This is a bunch of small tools that I didn't feel needed their own repos, so a
collective license will have to do.

All code, including example commands in documentation, should be considered
GPL v2 or GPL v3 or later -- whichever suits your needs better.

All documentation and examples here should be considered CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0 or
later.

If you need this to be stated more explicitly *within* any particular script,
I'd be happy to do that; let me know.
